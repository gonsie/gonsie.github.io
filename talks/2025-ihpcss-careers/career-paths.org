* Academia
** Academia
- Teaching at a college or university
- Each institution has a difference emphasis on 3 areas:
  - Teaching Responsibilities
  - Research (winning grants and writing publications)
  - Community Service (departmental roles, conference & journal organization)
- Some initial funding comes from the school, but then you must find more money
** Academic Career Path (US)
/titles may be different in different countries/
1. Post Doc (optional)
2. Assistant Professor, tenure track
3. Tenure
4. Full Professor
** Academia Pros
- You get to work with students through teaching and research
- You get to build your own lab
- Once you have tenure...
  - You are "unfireable and almost rich"
  - Can explore any research topic you want (/if you can get funding/)
  - Long term career path and stability
** Academia Cons
- You /have/ to work with students, teaching whatever classes need to be taught
- Getting tenure is difficult
- You have to move to wherever the school is
** How to Get Started
- Try teaching / being a teaching assistant
- Try mentoring undergraduates, new graduate students
- Talk to professors in your department
- /Talk to Tom Cheatham, Erwin Laure, Gladys Andino/
* Industry
** Industry
- Beholden to customers, must create products to sell
- Can work on government contracts / grants
** Industry Career Path
- Varies by scientific field & company
- Larger companies typically have well-defined career paths with a specific progression of job titles
- May look something like:
  1. Individual contributor
  2. Project lead
  3. Technical Expert
** Industry Pros
- Pay is usually higher than academia
- Company perks: free food, stock options, bonuses, sabbaticals
- May have the freedom to work remotely or more options of where in world/country to work
- You work with/for the customer
- Higher turnover, you can have a more varied career and change roles every few years
** Industry Cons
- You have to make a product / make a profit for the company
- Less freedom to do "pure" research
- You work with/for the customer
- Company culture may not have the best work/life balance
** How to Get Started
- Look for summer internship programs
- Go to career fairs / recruiting sessions
  - at your university
  - at conferences
- /Talk to Amuro Halawa, Jiachao Zhang/
* Supercomputer Center
** Supercomputer Center
- Could be associated with a University or Government Research lab
- Funding could depend on current political climate or vary depending on your current project
- Best of both academia and industry worlds:
  - No required teaching responsibilities
    - option to work with summer interns
    - possibility to do HPC training sessions
  - Understand basic research activities, such as publication and conference attendance
** Supercomputer Center Career Path
/many paths available, depending on role/
1. Individual contributor; Consultant/user support; Trainer
2. Team Lead or Project Lead
3. Management _or_ Technical Expert
** Supercomputer Center Pros
- Opportunity to do a specific role, such as user support or application development
- Opportunity to do "pure" research/get grants
- Some labs may have a "mission"
- No required teaching responsibilities
- Culture typically has good work/life balance
** Supercomputer Center Cons
- Government bureaucracy
- Federal funding, not as many perks as industry
- Not as well paid
- Employees are typically there for a long time, some can become "Retired In Place"
- Career path may be limited, depending on size/needs of the center
** How to Get Started
- Look for lab people in your research area, ask about an internship
- Look for summer internship programs
- Research if there are citizenship preferences for different labs
- /Talk to Elsa Gonsiorowski, Ilya Zhukov/
* Professional Organizations
** Professional Organizations
- Institution doesn't fully dictate career path
  - Do provide different opportunities and flavors of work
- To figure out what type of career you want, look for inspiration from others
- Join professional organizations and attend conferences for profession development
** Organizations of Interest
- [[https://www.acm.org/special-interest-groups/alphabetical-listing][ACM SIGs]] (Association of Computing Machinery Special Interest Groups)
- [[https://researchsoftware.org][Research Software Engineer]] (RSE) Societies
  - See also "Research Data Engineer" and "Research Infrastructure Engineer"
- [[https://carcc.org][CaRCC]]: Campus Research Computing Consortium and [[https://casc.org][CASC]]: Coalition for Academic Scientific Computation
- See IHPCSS organizers
** RSE Example Career Path
- Bring software engineering skills to research projects
#+begin_quote
those who regularly use expertise in programming to advance research. This includes researchers who spend a significant amount of time programming, full-time software engineers writing code to solve research problems, and those somewhere in-between. We aspire to apply the skills and practices of software development to research to create more robust, manageable, and sustainable research software.

** RSE Career Path
- Can be a domain scientist who picks up computer science / software engineering expertise
- Can be trained computer scientist who, over the course a career, supports research software in different domains
- Gaining more recognition as its own career path
** RSE Pros
- Diversity of projects, improves the quality of scientific research
- May have the potential to do "pure" research / get grants
** RSE Cons
- Funding for RSE's has traditionally been somewhat volatile, but "RSE" as a career path has been getting more recognition in recent years.
